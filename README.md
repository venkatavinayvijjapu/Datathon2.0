# About
The Project is to find secure and malcious websites using machine learning which also coverrs NLP. Moreover we use count vectorizes and TfIf vectorizer, here count vectorizer refers to the variable n a sentence and TfIf vectorization is ratio of Tf and If. It creates a dictionary based on unique words and assigned with frequency. In this project during the data preprocessing we commonl split '.','/',':' and remaning are neccesary for url to determine the url safety.
# Pre-requisites:
1)dataset
2)Pandas
3)Count vectorizer
4)TfiF vectorizer
#Preffrered classications:
SVC, Logestic regression,Random forest,decision tree,Naives based,Decision tree

Many algoritms are time consuming as dataset containg lakhs of urls.
